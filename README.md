# Plank 

A nice program to have all your major programs one click away.


# Installation of plank

	sudo apt-get install -y plank 

Your distro does not have it in its standard repositories.

	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ricotz
 	sudo apt-get update
 	sudo apt-get install plank

 # Installing the themes.


 Download this github and unzip.

 Copy all folders to 

 	~/.local/share/plank/themes

 or

 	/usr/share/plank/themes
